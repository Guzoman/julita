# Julia Confecciones - Migration Recommendations and Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the Access database structure and comparison with the proposed Supabase architecture, this document provides actionable recommendations for a successful migration. The legacy system contains sophisticated business logic that must be preserved while modernizing the technology stack.

## Key Findings

### Current System Strengths
1. **Deep Domain Knowledge**: The system reflects years of understanding the school uniform business
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 24 tables covering all business aspects
3. **Flexible Sales Process**: Multi-payment, credit sales, and customization support
4. **Production Tracking**: Worker assignment and output tracking
5. **Cash Management**: Detailed denomination-level tracking

### Current System Limitations
1. **Data Integrity**: No foreign key constraints, potential for orphaned records
2. **Scalability**: Access database size and concurrent user limitations
3. **Integration**: No API access, difficult to integrate with external systems
4. **Analytics**: Limited reporting and business intelligence capabilities
5. **Maintenance**: Manual backup processes, no real-time synchronization

## Migration Priorities
